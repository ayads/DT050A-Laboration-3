Implement a distributed election to process to elect a leader (Bully algorithm).

NOTE:
> In this last laboration you are expected to  This laboration is optional, but you must do it in order to be eligible to get an A or B on the course. You must finish this laboration before the course ends.

Use the basic program you coded in Laboration 1, which you now will need to extend to also do the following:
## Goal 
Implement a distributed election to process to elect a leader (Bully algorithm). As well as implement total ordering, managed by this leader.

## General Tasks
Implement the bully algorithm to elect a leader
- [ ] Send election message when nodes join, leave, or if the leader is disconnected.
- [ ] Everyone answers the election message.
- [ ] A winner is announced.
